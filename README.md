# FTP-Client-Server-Program
A pair of client-server programs that partially simulates the file transfer protocol (FTP) using Python stream sockets. The purpose is to allow the client to download files from the server directory to the client directory and upload files from the client directory to the server directory with both TCP and UDP protocols.
